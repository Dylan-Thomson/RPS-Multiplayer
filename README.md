# RPS-Multiplayer
When a user visits the web page, they can enter their name to join as a player if a spot is open.

Players can choose rock, paper, or scissors. When both players have picked a move, the result is determined. The result and the players' moves are displayed for a few seconds, then the players can each choose another move.

The game keeps track of wins/ties/losses for each player. When a player leaves, a new one can join and take their place.

Players can also send messages to each other in chat.

If both player slots are taken, the user can still join as a spectator. It is not necessary to join as a spectator to watch the game, but spectators can chat. When a spot opens up, a spectator has the option to add their name and join as a player.

This project was created for the CWRU Bootcamp. I used Bootstrap, jQuery, FontAwesome icons, and most of all, a Firebase realtime database to store player information.
